###Repo for iOS app for 'MealPal'  - a web-based application


##Problem Targeted 
Corporate employees generally have meal at the offices or Food Trucks or restaurants. On an average an employee has to spend $10 for his food.  
 
##Objective 
Expensive lunch at affordable prices with more options. 
 
##Summary 
MealPal is a web-based application which is working on the problem. It is changing the way lunch works. 

Consumers with MealPal pay as little as $5.19 per meal and get lunch from some of the best restaurants in their city. With over 1000 restaurants to choose from, getting a delicious and affordable lunch has never been easier. Restaurants in the MealPal network reach new customers while increasing revenue during peak lunch hours. Each restaurant in the MealPal network offers one lunch option per day, enabling them to efficiently grow their lunch time operations.

Currently MealPal do not have any mobile application, so we propose to develop an easy interface for the user to buy meal passes and order food.  
 
##Use case 
We propose the following use-cases: 
 	User is given an option to buy  6, 12 or 20 meal pass with a validity of 30 days depending on their needs.  
 	User can use his meal pass once daily to buy his lunch. He has to order his meal a day before from 5:30pm to 12:30pm. So that the restaurants can be ready with his lunch meal the next day before 12pm.  
 	Avoid waiting in line to order and pick food. Give your meal pal details to get your meal.
